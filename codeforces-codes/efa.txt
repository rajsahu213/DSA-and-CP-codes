The move of the government has brought hope in the hearts of the citizens that the government will not sit quietly if the other country does not respect India and will give a befitting reply to it in need and the present step of banning the apps is the proof of it. It is a kind of revenge taken by the government of India from Chinese government for mishandling the Indian user's data and their unnecessary steps taken on the border area to raise disputes.


However the solution to this is that the country should raise the standards of its own apps to such a level that the citizens naturally choose the local apps over the foreign ones and such heavy foreign dependency is not ensured anytime in the future and so such actions would not be needed in the coming times
